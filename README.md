# Brief üìñ

This project aims to be a
**[deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory)
tool**. You can upload images of questions or problems, assign tags to them, and
track which types of tags you fail the most, so you know where to focus. It also
uses a
**[Weighted Random Selection Algorithm](https://dev.to/jacktt/understanding-the-weighted-random-algorithm-581p)**
to suggest questions with higher error rates, making it easier to target your
weaknesses.
